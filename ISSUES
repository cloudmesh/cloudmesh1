*** DONE ./install user fails with "USER"				:bug:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-02-19 Thu 15:24]
    In `cloudmesh_install/install.py():190
    Call to `string.Template(results).substitute(os.environ)` fails with a KeyError.
    This is because in a docker build a user is not known

    My hack: set the USER environment variable in a docker-local build
    environment

*** TODO fab server.start cannot connect to mongo			:bug:
