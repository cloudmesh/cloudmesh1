CHANGES
=======

* PROPER SEARCH ON STATES: A proper serach function was added to the
  openstack library allowing simple or searches and regular expression
  searches based on any attribute a vm contains.

* FIX OF THE PROFILE VIEW: fixed the profile component so the prefix
  and the index can be edited in the provile window. Fixed the general
  layout and removed not needed editing functions. Saves cahnges
  directly into yaml file. Improved readability of the code by using
  proper variable names.

* FG-MANAGE SCRIPT: introduced the fg-manage command to create a novarc file for a cloud
  from the yaml file

* FG_KEYS: added the key management script that will replace the code
  in the server in future.

* FG_PROJECTS: designed a class to handle projects in a class with
  some simple methods. This will replace the code in the server.

* introduced a "cloud:" attribute in yaml so its easier to manage and
  extract the clouds without checking the type

* worked on a nasty bug in the refresh method of openstack, and it now
  refreshes even after you deleted all vms.

* changed the logic for the credentials and in addition to the clod:
  we have also a credentials: under each cloud

* added a new parameter to the get function in cm_config that if set
  to expand=True it will replace the $ vars with those defined in the
  os.environ, so this is cool as it allows us to use $ vars now also
  in the yaml file
